####sshb.sh

Sets a background color and background image containing the guest host name in [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com) depending on the host name. Seems to not work with iTerm 1.0 (stable), use a beta release instead.

Modified fork of [dotfiles](https://github.com/kpumuk/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/bin/sshb)
